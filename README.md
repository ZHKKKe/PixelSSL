PixelSSL is a PyTorch-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) codebase for pixel-wise (Pixel) vision tasks.

The purpose of this project is to promote the research and application of semi-supervised learning on pixel-wise vision tasks. PixelSSL provides two major features:
- Interface for implementing new semi-supervised algorithms
- Template for encapsulating diverse computer vision tasks

As a result, the SSL algorithms integrated in PixelSSL are compatible with all task codes inherited from the given template. 

In addition, PixelSSL provides the benchmarks for validating semi-supervised learning algorithms for some pixel-level tasks, which now include [semantic segmentation](task/sseg).
